however, the links are still there, the pictures do not pretend to be from somewhere else which SHOULD be at least something. I do hope there is not much to complain about. It's just a nice playful css experiment in a small training course, so please relax. so btw what happened to the other doggo pic you recently deleted? -->

              <p>That is nothing. My owner just started learning about "DOM Trees". And I was like...
